        <h1>The Mission</h1>
        <p>Operation Gratitude is a 501(c)(3) non-profit volunteer organization that “seeks to lift spirits and meet the evolving needs of our Military and First Responder communities, and provide volunteer opportunities for Americans to express their appreciation to all who serve our nation”. Each year, Operation Gratitude sends over 150,000 individually addressed care packages to our military personnel deployed overseas and their families, and to veterans and first-responders here at home.  The Tolland High School community would like to unite in its support to show that our “boots are on the ground” to help make this possible.</p>

        <h1>The Plan</h1>
        <p>The Tolland High School DECA chapter has taken the initiative to organize a school-wide care package assembly event to be held on May 24, 2016.  THS DECA and Tolland High School will be working on behalf of Operation Gratitude to raise money for the supplies needed to make 1650 care packages and 900 para-cord bracelets. (Paracord bracelets are woven bracelets made from survival cord that can hold up to 550 pounds.  In an emergency it can be quickly taken apart and used to save lives.)  Our care packages will include a variety of hygiene items such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, chapstick, etc. We will work together to raise the money, purchase and collect the necessary items, and then make the bracelets and package the items as a school-wide event to support our troops.</p>

        <h1>The Community</h1>
        <p>Tolland High School is asking the community to participate in this charitable event through individual and/or corporate sponsorship.  You too can show that your “boots are on the ground” by utilizing the Donate Here link above and contributing through a paypal donation, sending a monetary donation to THS DECA at the high school, or sponsoring a specific item to be included in the care package.  We will also have a number of classroom collections for students and faculty.  We are very excited about the opportunity to come together as a community to show our support for the troops that give up so much for us to enjoy the simple freedoms that make our country great.
